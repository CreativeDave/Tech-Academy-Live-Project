# The Tech Academy Forum
> A forum for The Tech Academy built in django with my classmates.
## Project Overview
Over the course of 2 weeks, we held daily standups and built the foundation of an exciting forum for the next generation of Tech Academy students to complete. This was a great opportunity to practice SCRUM methodology with other students, and learn how Azure Devops is used in the real world. After creating our own branch, we would recieve our tasks from the devops board and then commit our changes in visual studio using git version control.

### My Tasks
> My specific tasks were to edit the templates of the home/forum and the post page. This meant I had to design a way for the posts to sensibly display in the correct page containers and update as new threads and posts were added.
